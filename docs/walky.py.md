# Documentation for walky.py 

## Walky 
This is the central class which manages and uses all the other components of the robot. The parameters are defined in config_walky.py
This class is seriously behind crawly in development. It works (probably) but lacks all the new features which will be merged and
adapted from crawly at a later time. 

## move_forward 
This makes the crawler move forward in a coordinated way. Most of the funktionality lies in the other classes Joint and Leg
