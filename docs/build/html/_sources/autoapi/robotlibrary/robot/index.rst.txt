.. py:class:: Robot(rc)


   This is the central class which manages and uses all the other components of the robot. The parameters are defined in config.py

   .. py:method:: _drive(dir_l, dir_r)

      This abstracted driving function is only called locally by the other functions with better names. 
      It accelerates and decelerates to make driving more natural. Do not call directly!!


   .. py:method:: _drive_instantly(dir_l, dir_r)

      This abstracted driving function is only called locally by the other functions with better names. 
      It sets the speed immediatly. Do not call directly!!


   .. py:method:: set_speed_instantly(s)

      Sets the new speed immediately. Doesn't change the driving mode of the robot. 


   .. py:method:: set_speed(s)

      Sets the new speed and accelerates and decelerates. Doesn't change the driving mode of the robot. 


   .. py:method:: set_forward(f)

      Sets the direction of the robot. True means forward.


   .. py:method:: spin_right()

      Spin right indefinitely. 


   .. py:method:: spin_left()

      Spin left indefinitely. 


   .. py:method:: turn_right()

      This turns the robot to the right without it spinning on the spot. Each call makes the turn steeper.


   .. py:method:: turn_left()

      This turns the robot to the right without it spinning on the spot. Each call makes the turn steeper.


   .. py:method:: go_straight()

      Lets the robot go straight on. Usually called when a turn shall end. 


   .. py:method:: spin_before_obstacle(distance)

      This spins until the distance to an obstacle is greater than the given parameter __distance__.


   .. py:method:: toggle_spin(d)

      Toggle turn for the given duration. With each call the oppsoite direction(clockwise / anti-clockwise) is used.


   .. py:method:: random_spin(d)

      Randomly turn for the given duration.


   .. py:method:: stop()

      Stop the robot slowly by deceleration. 


   .. py:method:: emergency_stop()

      Stop the robot immediately.


   .. py:method:: ir_detected(pin, pin_num)

      If implemented this method is called when the IR-sensor has detected a change. Fill in your code accordingly


   .. py:method:: get_dist()

      Get the distance from the ultrasonic sensor.


   .. py:method:: set_angle(a)

      If implemented, turn the servo motor with the ultrasonic sensor to the given angle.


   .. py:method:: get_smallest_distance()

      This returns the angle of the ultrasonic sensor where it measured the smallest distance


   .. py:method:: get_longest_distance()

      This returns the angle of the ultrasonic sensor where it measured the longest distance
